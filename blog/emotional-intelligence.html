     <h3 class="green-text blog-post-title"> Emotional Intelligence</h3>

     <p class="blog-paragraph"> I will admit that before this module in sprint 3, I didn’t really have an idea as to exactly what emotional intelligence was, or how important it really is. However the more I looked into it, the more I realised this is something that I (and most people) should be trying to incorporate into our lives. </p>
      
      <h3 class="green-text blog-post-title">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
      
      <p class="blog-paragraph"> Everybody is aware of IQ (intelligence quotient) but not everyone is aware of EQ (emotional quotient). According to the dictionary definition by the Oxford Dictionaries emotional intelligence is described as the capacity to be aware of, control, and express one’s emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously, and empathetically. In simple terms this means to understand and control your emotions, in order to help you achieve your goals, and improve your day to day life.</p>
      
      <h3 class="green-text blog-post-title">Why should we practise Emotional Intelligence ?</h3>
      
      <p class="blog-paragraph">There are numerous benefits linked to practising and increasing your emotional intelligence. One of these includes increased self awareness. This allows you to get in touch with your emotions, and understand how they are affecting you, in order to better manage and control them. Another important benefit is the ability to build stronger relationships. With a higher emotional intelligence you have an easier time building trust, rapport,  and respect in both your professional life and your personal life. These benefits are really awesome, however the best one is an increase in general happiness. All of these benefits combined together, on top of being able to understand and manage your emotions leads to a happier and more fulfilling life. </p>
      
      <h3 class="green-text blog-post-title">How can we increase our Emotional Intelligence? </h3>
      
      <p class="blog-paragraph"> There are a few methods that can help you increase your emotional intelligence. These include things like journaling, mindfulness meditation and conscious listening. All of these will have a big impact on increasing your EQ. The one that I personally found most effective so far is mindfulness meditation. This involves getting into a comfortable position, and focusing on your breath. You don’t want to be thinking about anything, just remaining calm and focussed. Especially when starting out, you will notice thoughts that pop into your head. This is perfectly okay, just observe them, and move your focus back on your breathing. This has become super helpful in my day to day life, as I generally have a very busy mind. Taking 5 - 10 minutes out of my day to calm my mind down, and focus and be present in the moment has led to noticeable improvements. </p>
      
      <h3 class="green-text blog-post-title"> In Conclusion </h3>
      
      <p class="blog-paragraph">Emotional Intelligence is a key factor in your personal and professional life, and is absolutely something worth investing time into in order to improve. As stated there are numerous benefits that come from having a higher emotional intelligence. As stated at the start of this post, I didn’t really have much of an idea of what all of this entails, but upon doing further research I have learned a lot and am super excited to continue developing and improving my EQ. I have already noticed benefits throughout my day to day life, so I can’t wait to keep pushing that ceiling higher. </p>
