      <h3 class="blog-post-title green-text">  Neuroplasticity </h3>
      
      <p class="blog-paragraph">   Neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to adapt, and change based on the experiences it’s been through. The name is defined from the word Neuro, which relates to the neurons in your brain, and the word plasticity, which means easy to be shaped or moulded. When  you learn something, the neurons in your brain strengthen, the more frequently you use them, the stronger the connection gets. However if you stop using them, they eventually fade or even die. </p>
      
        <p class="blog-paragraph">   One interesting aspect of neuroplasticity, is that actually just understanding the concept, can have an effect on your ability to learn. When you understand how your brain functions, you can optimise your process of learning, in order to be more efficient. By understanding that your neurons get stronger the more you use them, and fade when you don’t use them, you can start to understand that when you are learning, you want to be learning often and frequently. </p>
      
          <p class="blog-paragraph">  There are a few ways in which you are able to increase your neuroplasticity. One of these is to make sure you’re getting enough sleep. Sleep allows your brain to work in its optimal state and can encourage greater neuroplasticity. Along with many other benefits provided by exercise, it has also been proven to increase the neuroplasticity in your brain. According to this study here <a class="blog-link" href="//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6296269/">//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6296269/</a> you can see the impact that exercise has on increasing your neural connections.</p>
      
      <h3 class="blog-post-title green-text">Growth Mindset</h3>
      
      <p class="blog-paragraph">   A growth mindset has been found to be very essential to success by many successful individuals. A growth mindset is the understanding that you are capable of improving and developing your abilities, whether physical or mental. This is especially relevant when trying to learn new things, or develop yourself as a person. This concept will come in handy no matter what you’re learning, whether it’s an instrument, a language, or anything at all. By understanding the fact that your skills and abilities aren’t set in stone, allows you to keep pushing and developing them further.  </p>
      
        <p class="blog-paragraph">  During my exploration of growth mindset vs fixed mindset, I actually learned a lot. I noticed myself subconsciously sharing a lot of tendencies with a fixed mindset. However it is very clear that the benefits of having a growth mindset is undeniable. After researching this topic I have been trying to change my perspective, in order to hold more of a growth mindset, in order to improve my ability to learn, and develop my skills. </p>
      
          <p class="blog-paragraph">  This is something I actively want to implement during my learning journey with Dev Academy, and throughout other areas of my life. I have already noticed this with some aspects while trying to solve a JavaScript problem. Previously when something wasn’t working, I would think to myself it’s too hard and I’m not capable of figuring it out. However, since I have done this research, I know for a fact that I will be able to solve it, and I am capable of doing this due to developing more of a growth mindset. If you want to go more in depth about this topic, I found this video by the Harvard Business Review very educational and entertaining <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0qpJxEhOP4" class="blog-link">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0qpJxEhOP4</a></p>
      
      <h3 class="blog-post-title green-text">Learning Plan</h3>
      
      <p class="blog-paragraph"> After studying and researching the concepts of Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset, I'm feeling much more confident in my ability to learn, adapt, and grow my skills. After taking a look at my learning plan, both of these concepts are things I definitely need to implement in order to achieve the best results. I’m going to add in an extra requirement to make sure I’m coding at least a little bit every day, in order to take advantage of neuroplasticity. I’m also going to make sure to bring a more open mind in order to benefit from having a growth mindset. With these two together I’m excited to see how far I can go and how much I can learn! </p>
