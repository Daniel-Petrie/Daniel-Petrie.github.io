          <h3 class="blog-post-title green-text"> What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">My long term goal is to get a job as a website developer. I haven’t decided yet whether I would prefer front-end, back-end, or full-stack.
          <h3 class="blog-post-title green-text">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
         <p class="blog-paragraph"> My main strength when it comes to learning is my perseverance. This means that even when things get hard, I keep pushing through it in order to make sure that I can complete the task. This is especially important for programming, as it can definitely be frustrating at times, but having the ability to persevere through the problems is always very useful. My biggest definition as listed below is my time management skills, but definitely something I am trying to improve on.</p>
          <h3 class="blog-post-title green-text">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
         <p class="blog-paragraph"> One thing that I really want to prioritise developing while attending Dev Academy is my time management skills. Before coming into this course I have had really poor time management skills, and I think it’s a skill that’s very important to have so I look forward to getting better at it. 
          <h3 class="blog-post-title green-text">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
           <p class="blog-paragraph"> There is quite a big workload for this course, so finding ways to manage it all is quite important. One of the main ways to work productively is to work well with other learners and facilitators. This works best in an open environment, where no one is afraid to ask questions or be judged. I think the Discord provides a great space for this, allowing students to help students when we inevitably get stuck on a problem. When things are building up and starting to get to me, the best thing to do is take a short break. Get up, stretch and go for a quick walk. I then find it best to come back and try and frame everything in my mind of what I need to achieve. I then try to start with the easy, small victories and build myself up. This makes a problem that once seemed impossible, start to feel a lot more doable.</p>
         <h3 class="blog-post-title green-text"> A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
         <p class="blog-paragraph"> If I get really stuck, seeking help is very important. The main thing for me is not get stuck on a problem for a few days, and realise that it’s better to ask for help sooner rather than later. When I realise I do need help, I will ask in the Discord where other students or the facilitators will be able to help me out. </p>
         <h3 class="blog-post-title green-text"> A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
         <p class="blog-paragraph"> Realistically I don’t expect too much from the facilitation team. The main thing I would expect is just answering questions where we have them, but I think the team is doing a really good job as it is now.</p>
          <h3 class="blog-post-title green-text">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in</h3>
         <p class="blog-paragraph"> At this current stage I don’t have too many commitments to other things apart from this course, as I wanted to make sure I have enough time to effectively complete this course. The only times when I am busy are Wednesday evenings, and most of Saturday as I am committed to football. </p>
