      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h1>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
      I returned a shopping trolley. It may not seem like an obvious ethical decision, but I think it’s a perfect example of what an ethical decision represents. There is no downside to returning a shopping trolley, it only takes a little bit of extra time, however at the same time, you personally don’t gain anything out of doing this. Team work and responsibility are two values I hold highly, and this encapsulates both of them. By taking a little time out of my day, it greatly helps the workers and everyone around. Reflecting on it I am proud that I always choose to return the shopping trolley, as I know it is the right thing to do.

      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
      The people around me definitely have had a huge impact on my values and identity. As the saying goes, “you are the sum of the 5 people you spend the most time with,” and I think this is very true. For example, my Mum has had a massive influence on me growing up. From a very young age she instilled in me some very important qualities, including perseverance, kindness, and determination to never give up. The qualities have set me up for life, and I know I would be a very different person without her.

      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
      I think my biggest strengths are my perseverance and dedication. This seems like quite an important skill set to have as a programmer. At times coding can feel very frustrating, but having the dedication to never give up and keep trying always helps me get through whatever problem or challenge I may run into.

      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
      I think my biggest limitations right now are my poor time management skills, and the fact I am easily distracted. Both of these factors definitely can be a problem in making sure I complete all my work on time. However I’ve been learning to work on it by strictly scheduling blocks of time in which I need to achieve a specific task, and also pairing that with something like the pomodoro technique, to make sure I’m being effective with my time.

      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h1>

      During a football game, team-work is one of the most important things in order for a team to perform well and win games. One of the key factors in this is working well with your team-mates, by passing the ball around and not holding onto it yourself. One of our team mates was not following that philosophy, they were selfish while playing causing some problems with the team. In order to resolve this issue, we took a very simple approach. We sat down with him and had a conversation. We explained to him what he was doing, and showed him the problems that this was causing. It was just a case that he didn’t really understand the impact he was having. Upon having this simple conversation, he quickly improved. Upon reflection this turned out to be a very simple, but effective method. We could have gone in a lot more harsh and yelled at him, but that would have unsettled him. Sometimes just giving someone a gentle nudge with kind words is enough to solve the problem.
